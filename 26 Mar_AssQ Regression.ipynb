    "## Simple Linear Regression:\n",
    "Simple linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between two variables: one independent variable (also known as the predictor or feature) and one dependent variable (also known as the response). The relationship is assumed to be linear, meaning that a straight line is used to represent the relationship between the variables. The goal of simple linear regression is to find the best-fitting line that minimizes the distance between the observed data points and the line.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's consider a simple example of predicting the score of a student in a math test (dependent variable) based on the number of hours they studied (independent variable). Here, the number of hours studied is the predictor, and the math test score is the response variable. We collect data from several students, record their study hours and corresponding scores, and then use simple linear regression to find the line that best fits the data, allowing us to predict the math test score for a given number of study hours.  \n",

    "# Multiple Linear Regression:\n",
    "Multiple linear regression, on the other hand, extends the concept of simple linear regression to model the relationship between a single dependent variable and multiple independent variables. In this case, there are two or more independent variables that can influence the dependent variable, and the relationship is assumed to be a linear combination of these variables.\n",

    "Suppose we want to predict the price of a house (dependent variable) based on various factors, such as the size of the house, the number of bedrooms, and the distance to the nearest school (independent variables). Here, we have three predictors: house size, number of bedrooms, and distance to the nearest school. We collect data on multiple houses, including these three features and their corresponding prices. By using multiple linear regression, we can determine how each independent variable contributes to the house price and create a model to predict the price of a new house based on its size, number of bedrooms, and distance to the nearest school."

    "If multicollinearity is detected in the multiple linear regression model, several techniques can be employed to address the issue:\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Combine Variables: Instead of using individual predictors, create composite variables or index that capture the essence of the highly correlated variables. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a technique that can help in creating new uncorrelated variables from a set of correlated variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Ridge Regression: Ridge regression, also known as L2 regularization, adds a penalty term to the loss function that forces the regression coefficients to be small. This helps stabilize the coefficient estimates and reduces the impact of multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Use Regularization Techniques: Other regularization methods like Lasso Regression (L1 regularization) or Elastic Net Regression (combination of L1 and L2 regularization) can also help in addressing multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Data Collection: Collecting more data can sometimes help in reducing multicollinearity as new observations may provide different patterns of correlation."
